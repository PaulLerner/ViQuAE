# MEERQAT
Source code and data used in my PhD/MEERQAT project.

## `data`

All the data should be stored there, although it will probably not be hosted on github (depending on the dataset size)
## `meerqat`
This should contain all the source code and act as a python package (e.g. `import meerqat`)

### `meerqat.data`

This should contain scripts to load the data, annotate it...

### `meerqat.visualization`

This should allow to visualize the data
